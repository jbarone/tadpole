Welcome to the Timeline Anomaly Detection tool (TADpole) project!

TADpole was developed as part of research for Automated Timeline
Anomaly Detection. The tool is intended to be used when triaging a
suspected system. TADpole will work with a forensic disk image and
look for event logs, which it will use to determine if the system
clock has been tampered with.

USAGE
--------------------

usage: tadpole [options] image [image]

    OPTIONS:
        -i imgtype: The format of the image file
           (use '-i list' for supported types)
        -f: Scan files in image for anomalies in MAC time
        -x: Output in XML format
        -v: verbose output to stderr


Why TADpole?
--------------------

the TAD in TADpole stands for Timeline Anomaly Detection. The rest
was chosen cause it just fit so well.
